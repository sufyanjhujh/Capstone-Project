            <p>IEC students are intentional about experiencing life together and digging deep into one another's lives. Our students are actively committed to supporting each other in their passions and dynamic pursuit of Christ. When you attend IEC, you’ll become part of a Christian campus community that is learning, growing, and having a blast together.</p>
            <p>At IEC you'll find opportunities to grow spiritually with fellow students, develop lasting relationships, and take on leadership roles that build upon the knowledge you’re gaining in the classroom. We have high hopes for you during your time at IEC: Presenting everyone perfect in Christ.</p>
            <p>We're here to serve you throughout your college journey. We’re here for you as you explore living as a Christian on our beautiful campus at the foot of the Colorado Rockies. We also assign each student a personal advisor who will guide you through your academic and life planning process.</p>
            <p>There is plenty to do at IEC whether you live on campus or off campus. Learn about the student activities available to our students, and let us know if you want more information about Colorado and what it’s like to go to college in our beautiful state!</p>
            <p>Know what you're passionate about? If you can’t find something that suits you here, we challenge you to start a new club, organization or ministry!</p>
